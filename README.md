# 💼 E-Commerce Sales Chatbot

An interactive AI-powered chatbot for an e-commerce platform, designed to assist users in product discovery and simulate the entire sales journey from search to purchase.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a full-stack e-commerce chatbot system that enhances the user shopping experience. The chatbot interacts with users via a conversational UI and fetches product data using a Django-powered RESTful API from a mock database.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Enable intelligent product search and discovery via chatbot interface.
* Provide a responsive, engaging, and session-aware UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* Implement authentication, product filtering, and chat history management.
* Simulate backend server with a mock inventory of 100+ products.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Backend (Django)

```bash
cd backend/
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata mock_products.json
python manage.py runserver
```

### 🌐 Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
npm start
```

## 📌 Sample API Endpoints

* `GET /api/products/?search=phone` – Search for products
* `POST /api/auth/login/` – Authenticate user
* `POST /api/chats/` – Log chatbot interaction
* `GET /api/chats/?user_id=1` – Get previous chats for user

## 🧐 Design Decisions

* **Django** was selected for its scalability, built-in admin interface, and robust API development via Django REST Framework.
* **React** offers component-driven architecture and flexibility for chatbot UI rendering.
* **SQLite3** serves well for mock data and rapid prototyping.
* Modular separation ensures maintainability and fault tolerance.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                        | Solution                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time session tracking       | Used `localStorage` with React Context API to persist session states. |
| Efficient product filtering      | Backend-level filtering with query params and pagination.             |
| Chat history management          | Logged all interactions in DB via Django models.                      |
| Responsive design on all devices | Used Tailwind/MUI and tested layout with dev tools.                   |
